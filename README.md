# Maze solver (using A* algorithm)

This project aims to solve mazes using the A* algorithm. The A* algorithm is a popular pathfinding algorithm widely used in robotics and video games due to its efficiency and ability to find the shortest path between two points in a maze.

# Features
- Generates random mazes of customizable dimensions using the `pyamaze` library.
- Implements the A* algorithm to find the shortest path from the start to the target cell in the maze.
- Visualizes the maze solving process using graphical representations.
- Provides metrics such as the length of the A* path to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.

# Getting Started
To use this project, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required library using pip:
`pip install pyamaze`
